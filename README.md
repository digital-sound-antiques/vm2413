vm2413
======

A YM2413 clone module written in VHDL

## Extra Register

Unlike the original YM2413 chip, VM2413's voice parameters are stored in the extra registers 0x40 to 0xD7.
Thus the all embedded voice can be modified. This means that we can use user-defined voice for every channels
by mapping different voice to each channel.

By default, the extra registers are disabled. To enable them, set the bit 7 of register 0xF0 to `1`. 

|Address|Voice|
|:-:|:-:|
|0x40-0x47|@15 User|　　　　　　
|0x48-0x4F|@0 Violin|
|0x50-0x57|@1 Guitar|
|0x58-0x5F|@2 Piano|
|0x60-0x67|@3 Flute|
|0x68-0x6F|@4 Clarinet|
|0x70-0x77|@5 Oboe|
|0x78-0x7F|@6 Trumpet|
|0x80-0x87|@7 Organ|
|0x88-0x8F|@8 Horn|
|0x90-0x97|@9 Synthesizer|
|0x98-0x9F|@10 Harpsicode|
|0xA0-0xA7|@11 Vibraphone|
|0xA8-0xAF|@12 Synthesizer bass|
|0xB0-0xB7|@13 Wood bass|
|0xB8-0xBF|@14 Electrical bass|
|0xC0-0xC7|BD|
|0xC8-0xCF|HH & SD|
|0xD0-0xD7|TOM & CYM|

The extra registers need 42 us (152 clocks) waiting time for each access.

Note that MSX-BASIC's MML do not allow to access the extra registers.
If you try to test this feature from 1chip MSX (a commercial product which employes VM2413), use `OUT` command instead.
